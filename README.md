MY BIGGEST PROJECT THIS FAR: FULL MERN STACK WEB STORE!

-------

I used: 

React-bootstrap
React-router
Express
NodeJS
Postman
MongoDB
Nodemon
Redux
JWT (JSON WEB TOKEN)
PayPal API

and much more. I know, I am missing some things but it was really large project and I just finished it and wanted to share if with the world (: 

Brief description: 

Full MERN stack web store where you can buy stuff (right now I have only PayPal SandBox API installed), register a user, leave reviews (only once per product). As an admin, you can look at orders, users, products. From front end you can add and delete products to/from database and it will be shown on page. Everything works, it might not be that beautiful, design wise, but thats just sugar. (: 
As an admin you can also delete users, delete products, delete reviews and everything can be done from frontend without going to backend. 

I used postman and I am very familiar with it by now. I know how servers work with databases and I have experience with SQL and mongoDB was not that hard. 

Finished and deployed with Heroku: https://palacebabyapp.herokuapp.com/

//Feel free to register user, place order and use PayPal SandBox API to pay for order.
